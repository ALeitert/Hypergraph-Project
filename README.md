# ST: Algorithmic Hypergraph Theory - Coding Project #

This is the coding project for the *ST: Algorithmic Hypergraph Theory* class, Kent State University, Spring 2015. 
The task is to visualise a hypertree based on its underlying tree.

## Features ##

- Load, save, edit and generate hypergraphs.
- If it is a hypertree, show the visualisation.
    - Determine if hypergraph is hypertree.
    - Find underlying tree.
    - Generate drawing for tree.
    - Add hyperedges (subtrees).
- Proper minimum colouring of the hyperedges.
- Output as file.

## Version Info ##

The program is written in C# using Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.
The used .NET version is 3.5.
